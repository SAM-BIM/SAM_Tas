**SAM_Tas** is part of the **SAM (Sustainable Analytical Model) Toolkit** —  
an open-source collection of tools designed to help engineers create, manage,
and process analytical building models for energy and environmental analysis.

This repository provides **integration between SAM analytical models and the Tas EDSL simulation engine**,
enabling building performance simulations to be executed in Tas using data derived from SAM workflows.

The integration supports the preparation, execution, and post-processing of Tas simulations
based on SAM analytical models, and is intended to be used alongside the SAM core libraries
and related SAM-BIM modules.

Welcome — and let’s keep the open-source journey going. 🤝
